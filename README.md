## Overview
Service Screener is a tool that runs automated checks on AWS environments and provides recommendations based on AWS and community best practices. 

AWS customers can use this tool on their own environments and use the recommendations to improve the Security, Reliability, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency and Cost Optimisation at the service level. 

This tool aims to complement the [AWS Well Architected Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool/). 

## How does it work?
Service Screener uses [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/), a free service that provides a browser-based shell to run scripts using the AWS CLI. It runs multiple `describe` and `get` API calls to determine the configuration of your environment.

## How much does it cost?
Running this tool is free as it is covered under the AWS Free Tier. If you have exceeded the free tier limits, each run will cost less than $0.01.

## Prerequisites
1. Please review the [DISCLAIMER](./DISCLAIMER.md) before proceeding. 
2. You must have an existing AWS Account.
3. You must have an IAM User with sufficient read permissions. Here is a sample [policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/ReadOnlyAccess.html). Additionally, the IAM User must also have the following permissions:
   - AWSCloudShellFullAccess
   - cloudformation:CreateStack
   - cloudformation:DeleteStack

4. (Optional) If you need to run cross-account operations, additional permissions are required:
   - iam:SetSecurityTokenServicePreferences

### Why CloudFormation Permissions Are Required

Service Screener creates a temporary, empty CloudFormation stack during each run for audit and compliance purposes. This stack:

- **Contains no actual resources** - It's an empty "marker" stack that incurs no cost
- **Provides audit trail** - Creates a record in AWS CloudTrail of when Service Screener was executed
- **Enables compliance tracking** - Allows organizations to track security assessment activities
- **Supports partner integrations** - Enables tracking for AWS Partner evaluations (MPE)

The stack is automatically created at the start of each run with a unique name (format: `ssv2-xxxxxxxxxxxx`) and can be safely deleted after the assessment is complete. This approach leverages AWS's built-in audit capabilities without requiring additional logging infrastructure.

## Installing service-screener V2
1. [Log in to your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#start-session) using the IAM User with sufficient permissions described above. 
2. Launch [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#launch-region-shell) in any region. 
3. In the AWS CloudShell terminal, run this script to install the dependencies:
   ``` bash
   cd /tmp
   python3 -m venv .
   source bin/activate
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   rm -rf service-screener-v2
   git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/service-screener-v2.git
   cd service-screener-v2
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 unzip_botocore_lambda_runtime.py
   
   # Build Cloudscape UI (required for --beta 1 mode)
   cd cloudscape-ui
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ..
   
   alias screener='python3 $(pwd)/main.py'
   ```

   **Note:** AWS CloudShell comes with Node.js pre-installed. The Cloudscape UI build takes approximately 30-60 seconds.
   
   **Important:** If you skip the Cloudscape UI build step, the `--beta 1` flag will still work but will only generate the legacy AdminLTE UI. To use the new Cloudscape UI features, you must complete the build step above.

## Using Service Screener
When running Service Screener, you will need to specify the regions and services you would like it to run on. For the full list of services currently supported, please see "SERVICES_IDENTIFIER_MAPPING" in [Config.py](./utils/Config.py).

We recommend running it in all regions where you have workloads deployed in. Adjust the commands below to suit your needs then copy and paste it into CloudShell to run Service Screener. 

**Example 1: (Recommended) Run in the Singapore region, check all services with NEW Cloudscape UI enabled**
``` bash
screener --regions ap-southeast-1 --beta 1
``` 

**Example 1a: Run in the Singapore region, check all services with legacy AdminLTE UI**
``` bash
screener --regions ap-southeast-1
```

**Example 2: Run in the Singapore region, check only Amazon S3**
``` bash
screener --regions ap-southeast-1 --services s3
```

**Example 3: Run in the Singapore & North Virginia regions, check all services**
``` bash
screener --regions ap-southeast-1,us-east-1
```

**Example 4: Run in the Singapore & North Virginia regions, check RDS and IAM**
``` bash
screener --regions ap-southeast-1,us-east-1 --services rds,iam
```

**Example 5: Run in the Singapore region, filter resources based on tags (e.g: Name=env Values=prod and Name=department Values=hr,coe)**
``` bash
screener --regions ap-southeast-1 --tags env=prod%department=hr,coe
```

**Example 6: Run in all regions and all services**
``` bash
screener --regions ALL
```

**Example 7: Run with suppression file to ignore specific findings**
``` bash
screener --regions us-east-1 --services s3 --suppress_file ./suppressions.json
```

## Performance Options

### Disable Custom Pages
For faster scans focused on core AWS service analysis, you can disable custom pages processing:

``` bash
screener --regions ap-southeast-1 --services ec2,s3,rds --disable-custom-pages 1
```

This skips processing of:
- **Cost Optimization Hub (COH)** - AWS cost optimization recommendations
- **Trusted Advisor (TA)** - TA check results and pillar organization  
- **Findings aggregation** - Cross-service findings analysis
- **Modernize recommendations** - Modernization pathway analysis

**Performance benefits:**
- **Time savings:** ~2-3 minutes per scan
- **Faster execution:** Focuses only on core service security checks
- **Reduced API calls:** Skips COH, TA, and aggregation APIs

**Use cases:**
- CI/CD pipeline integration where speed is critical
- Quick security validation checks
- Development and testing environments
- Core service analysis without additional insights

**Example: Fast security scan**
``` bash
screener --regions us-east-1 --services ec2,iam,s3 --disable-custom-pages 1 --beta 1
```

## Other parameters

### Suppression File
To suppress specific findings, create a JSON file with the suppressions and use the `--suppress-file` parameter:

```json
{
 "metadata": {
   "version": "1.0",
   "description": "Your suppression description"
 },
 "suppressions": [
   {
     "service": "s3",
